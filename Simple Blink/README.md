# Multiple Blink

## Purpose
Blink a Single LED on the Processor

## Theory

In order to blink one LED a loop constantly runs that has a one million clock cycle delay. Since the main clock runs at 1 MHz, the LED blinks at approximately a period of one second.

## Board Features
All boards work the same way, the infinite loop causes the Red LED on the board to blink approximately every second.
